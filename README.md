# Lettuce Growth Analysis: Environmental Factors and Growth Rate

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how environmental factors — temperature, humidity, pH, and total dissolved solids (TDS) — affect the growth rate of lettuce over a 44-day period. A sample plant (Plant ID 1) was analyzed to explore trends, patterns, and potential relationships between environmental conditions and growth.  

The goal is to demonstrate:  
- **Data cleaning and standardization**  
- **Pivot tables and descriptive statistics**  
- **Data visualization (line and scatter plots)**  
- **Analytical reporting and insights**  

> **Note:** Findings are based on a single sample plant and may not represent all lettuce growth.

## Analysis Summary

### pH
- Average: 6.72 | Standard deviation: 0.22  
- Stable pH supports consistent lettuce growth  

### Temperature
- Average: [average]°C | Standard deviation: 2.38°C  
- Line graph shows slight downward trend with occasional dips, indicating moderately stable conditions  

### Humidity
- Average: 63.96% | Standard deviation: 9.28%  
- Moderate fluctuations but stable for growth 

### Temperature vs Humidity
- Scatter plot suggests slightly higher humidity on warmer days, with notable points at 20°C and 23°C  

### TDS vs pH
- pH remained stable (6–7) across TDS range 550–700ppm  
- Most points cluster at pH 6 for TDS 550ppm and 700ppm  

### Growth Patterns
- Steady growth observed over 44 days  
- Temperature and humidity appear to influence growth more than pH or TDS
